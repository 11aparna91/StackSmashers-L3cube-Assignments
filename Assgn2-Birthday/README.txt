Birthday Paradox - 
This paradox concerns with a fact that in a group of n randomnly chosen people, some of them will have the same
birthday. According to the paradox the probability is very high than what we imagine it to be.
With just a group of 23 people in a room there's 50% chance that two people have the same birthday.
With just 75 people the probability shoots up to .999

In this code we verify the Birthday paradox
Input - Number of people in the room.
1) With the number of people in the room we use the probability formula given in the code to find the 
probability of clashing birthdays.
2) We take 1000 set of number of people and assign random birthdays to them.
3) After this we check for the set with clashing birthdays and count them.
4) We check the probability of the clashing birthdays with random set and with the formula and 
find it to be similar to each other.

Output - Probability by formula and Probability with random sets is somewhat similar.
